==============================

Due to this COVID-19 pandemic the loss bearers are the small scale retailers and Kirana stores. The aim of this project is to bridge the gap between the customer and the retailer/Kirana store through WhatsApp chatbot. The reason to choose Whatsapp is that it is used by almost everyone and it will be a great medium to promote their businesses. Besides that, the additional advantage is that the entry barrier to enter into the market would be reduced. This makes the retailer to just provide their WhatsApp business number instead of creating and spending money on websites.
